# Demo of Styles

Front End app developed from a company branded 'lookbook' type 'Demo of Styles' website, originally made for a financial sector client in 2025. 

Existing WordPress/PHP site suffered from:
* Slow loading, with one page as low as FCP 3s, LCP 13.6s, CLS 0.342s and a speed index of 3.9s, overall score of 49 on mobile, risking high bounce rates
* Staff finding updates extremely difficult without breaking layouts 
* Lack of responsive design: clunky vertical stacking, illegibly small text and inadequate touch targets for critical call to action buttons 
* Poor graphic quality: blurry graphics, poor contrast, inconsistent layouts & assets / font sizing and an overall lack of visual consistency  

As their business had grown since the original launch, their goals were:
* Faster performance 
* Modern branding and professional-standard layouts 
* Printable sections
* Flexible component library with a CMS so staff could quickly edit without layout issues
