# Demo of Styles

[View Site](https://react-typescript-ui-demo-production.up.railway.app/)
Front End app developed from a company branded 'lookbook' type website, originally made with branding for a financial sector client in 2025.

### Technologies & Libraries:

- React 19 with TypeScript
- React Router v7
- DomPurify
- FontAwesome SVG Icons

Self-hosted assets:

- Variable fonts in WOFF/WOFF2
- WebP & AVIF images
- mp4 Video background

---

### Team Structure

- **Front End Developer:** Sole responsibility for design and implementation using React v19 + TypeScript in Vite; data populated from `.ts` files

- **Back End Developer:** Client liaison, build the CMS layer/middleware and migrate existing database

---

### Deliverables

#### Performance

- Lighthouse scores improved to 98 - 100 on desktop, 77 - 91 with speed index average of 1.8s on mobile
- Including large video hero

#### Layout

- Default Homepage: video hero section
- Three variants with static hero images
- Animated KPI counter demo
- Wave section divider and thematic page background colors
- Shaped highlight boxes for key headlines
- Printable light-mode sections for on demand PDFs

#### Accessibility

- Audited using WAVE Evaluation Tool & tested with Mac Voice Over screen reader

---

### Challenges

- Presenting multiple options without a reference design or design brief
- Optimising images and an mp4, without a CDN at this stage
- Rapid changes from feedback including at the last minute

---

### Problem to Solve

Existing WordPress/PHP site suffered from:

- Slow loading, with one page as low as FCP 3s, LCP 13.6s, CLS 0.342s and a speed index of 3.9s, overall score of 49 on mobile, risking high bounce rates
- Staff finding updates extremely difficult without breaking layouts
- Lack of responsive design: clunky vertical stacking, illegibly small text and inadequate touch targets for critical call to action buttons
- Poor graphic quality: blurry, poor contrast, inconsistent layouts & assets / font sizing and an overall lack of visual consistency

As their business had grown since the original launch, their goals were:

- Faster performance
- Modern branding and professional-standard layouts
- Printable sections
- Flexible component library with a CMS so staff could quickly edit without layout issues

---

### Outcome

Client approved the work for MVP development, scheduled to begin in late autumn 2025.
